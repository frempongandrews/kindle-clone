This project is from [LetsBuildThatApp](https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/). <br /><br />

After reading a few posts and watching a few videos (links below) I have decided to go with the programmatic 
approach. It is slower but will definitely be beneficial in the long run as also underlined by <bold>Sean Allen</bold>.

Project based learning definitely makes things easier though.

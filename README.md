<h1>Project 1 - Kindle clone (Programmatic UI)</h1>
I am learning iOS development in swift. <br /><br />

This project is from [LetsBuildThatApp](https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/). <br /><br />

After reading a few posts and watching a few videos I have decided to go with the programmatic 
approach. It is slower but will definitely be beneficial in the long run as also underlined by <bold>Sean Allen</bold>. 
<br /><br />
Project based learning definitely makes things easier though.

    <li>UINavigationController</li>
